// DOM Manipulation using JavaScript

// Something we wont be doing is reaching out to the website and manipulate the DOM manually.
// But it is a strength of JS to do it in runtime.
// We won't be doing it in React either, because React will do it for us.
// Because we'll write React code in a declarative way.

const list = document.querySelector('ul');
list.remove(); // removes the ul element from the DOM.


// My research notes on DOM:

// basically a programming interface that lets you interact with and manipulate the structure of a web page.
// tree-like representation of everything in an HTML (or XML) document.
